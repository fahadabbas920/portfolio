          <p className="showing">
            I'm a Front-End Developer. I have serious passion for web
            applications, animations and creating intuitive dynamic user
            experiences. The passion and enthusiasm for computer world
            encouraged me to persue my bachelor degree and career in Computer
            Science field.
          </p>
          <p className="showing">
            I don’t like to define myself by the work I’ve done. I define myself
            by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught, personality is
            inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself,
            and do interesting things that matter.
          </p>
          <p className="showing">
            Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, I’m easily
            inspired and more then willing to follow my fascinations wherever
            they take me. I’m passionate, expressive, multi-talented spirit with
            a natural ability to entertain and inspire. I’m never satisfied to
            just come up with ideas. Instead I have an almost impulsive need to
            act on them.
          </p>
          <p className="showing">
            My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests,
            hobbies, areas of study and artistic endeavors. I’m a fast learner,
            able to pick up new skills and juggle different projects and roles
            with relative ease.
          </p>
          <p className="showing">
            I like to develop expertise in a number of areas over the course of
            my life and career. I'm currently a last year bachlor of computer
            science student and open for new opportunities.
