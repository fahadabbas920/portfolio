          I'm a front-end web Developer, currently in my last year of bachlor of
          computer science. I love teaching myself new things. I started with
          computers in high school and college, then learned about Web
          development and all the rest. Now that I’ve gotten this far, I can’t
          stop thinking about achieving even more. It’s advantageous, and I hope
          to learn more about the field as my career progresses.
